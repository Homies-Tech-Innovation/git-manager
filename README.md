## About The Project

<!-- <div align="center">
  <img src="./assets/image1.svg" alt="Project Banner" width="100%" style="max-width: 1200px;">
</div> -->

**Git Manager** helps teams transform dense technical documents into structured, actionable GitHub tasks. Instead of manually parsing requirements, our system automates task creation with clear instructions, labels, and dependencies.

**Core Features (MVP):**

- **Automated Task Breakdown** → Converts documents into granular GitHub issues.
- **Dependency Mapping** → Ensures tasks are linked correctly (blocked by / prerequisite of).
- **Labeling Conventions** → Applies consistent labels across tasks for smooth project tracking.

Future releases will extend this foundation with specialized models for categorization, prioritization, and full automation of GitHub workflows.

## Getting Started

> \[!WARNING]
> This project is in early development and not yet functional.

Once released, installation instructions and setup steps will be documented here.

## Usage

> \[!CAUTION]
> Active development in progress. Features may change rapidly.

The end goal is simple:

1. Provide a technical document as input.
2. Automatically generate GitHub issues with metadata.
3. Manage project flow directly in GitHub Projects.

## Roadmap

- **MVP:** Convert dense documents into structured GitHub tasks with metadata and dependencies.
- **v2:** Generate branch name from conventions and issue title.
- **v3:** Fill out PR body according to issue and changes.

See the [open issues](./issues) for proposed features and known issues.
